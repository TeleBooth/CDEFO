      <h1>Capstone Fair</h1>
 
    <p>I will say, first off, that I shouldn’t have rushed the setup, it ultimately just made things worse. 
The hardware ended up looking great, but I didn’t have time to actually sync the softwares and make sure I had everything I needed open.</p>

<p>I also should’ve closed the door so that a crowd that large wouldn’t have piled up, because that also didn’t help the nerves.</p>

<p>I also should’ve just ignored the hardware bugs that kept popping up and focused more on making sure the user experiences <em>were actually setup.</em>
It did provide a pretty good demonstration of the writing capabilties of the project, though, 
considering I was able to take a blank tag and program a user experience on the fly, as well as talk about the commandline standard I was using.</p>

<p>At least I was still able to get the parts working separately so that I could at least show everyone the lights and the music separately. 
Even then, I found it kind of funny how a lot people thought that the music with a static colored background was my project. 
I really wish I could’ve shown them everything working together.</p>

<p>Speaking of everything working together, at this point, there aren’t any software bugs, but the hardware bugs make the platform incredibly unstable.
Pretty much the only experience I can actually run is John Fitzell’s because it doesn’t make use of the EQ at the same time as the NFC reader.</p>

<p>I also feature this video later in the tutorial I provide, <em>which I highly recommend you look through because I took a lot of time to make it and I think I did well :).</em> It also provides a good overview of all of the parts working independantly.</p>

<p>Anyways, other than the reactions of the kids, It seemed that Jara and Krista both enjoyed the project in its semi working state, I remember Jara being particularly interested in the software portion and how I had threaded the Arduino.
Jason seemed to really enjoy the concept when I described it to him, and hoped that I would continue working on it and fleshing it out (he mentioned something about a hypothetical Capstone Extension).
Joseph sadly didn’t get to see much of it. The worst part is that due to the distractions caused by the Capstone not working, I didn’t actually get any photos of the whole room assembled.</p>

<p>In terms of what specifically went wrong during the Capstone Fair, and what keeps going wrong,
I will discuss this in the <a href="http://localhost:4000//CDEFO/_pages/documentation/music_light.html">second document</a> where I go over the hardware bugs that plagued my Capstone and how I still have no idea what’s causing them.</p>
